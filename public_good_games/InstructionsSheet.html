        <strong>1. Rules, Procedures and Decisions</strong>
    </h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment. Each participant of this experiment
        is a member of a five-person group, which is randomly formed. No participant knows their
        group members or which group they belong to.
    </p>
    <p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;">Procedures</strong> By now, you should have an envelope and a code
            number card, which you randomly selected in front of the class. Please write your code number on the front
            of the envelope and take care to keep the code number card as you need it to collect your payment.
            Do not open your envelope until we ask you to. During the experiment, you can ask us
            questions, but you are not allowed to talk to other participants.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
            Before starting the experiment, please read this instructions sheet carefully. You will be
            given 5 minutes to read this instructions. When the 5 minutes reading time is up, we will
            hold a 5 minute Q&A session. Raise your hand if you have any questions and we will come
            to you and answer your question individually. After the Q&A session, we will proceed to
            the actual experiment by asking you to open your envelope. Then, fill out the questionnaire
            and enter your decision in the sheet provided.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
            After you have finished filling out the questionnaire and entering your decision, put this
            instructions sheet and the decision sheet back into your envelope. When everyone has put
            his/her sheets inside his/her envelope, we will collect all the envelopes and you can leave the
            room. After next class meeting, we will distribute your payment.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;">Decisions</strong> The decision you have to make in this experiment is
            the following: each of you will be given 20 tokens of which you can keep or invest in a group account.
            Simultaneously, all other members of your group have to make the similar decision. None of you will be able
            to see the others’ decision or the total number of tokens invested in the group account.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
            You have to enter your decision on the decision sheet provided inside your envelope. On
            it, there will a box where <strong>you should circle the number of token(s) you want to invest in the group
            account</strong>. The box will look like the following.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center m-0">
            <img src="{{ static 'token.png'}}" alt="token" style="width: 70%;">
        </div>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
            After deciding on how many token(s) you want to invest in the group account, we will
            ask you to write down how many tokens do you think there are in the group account. Note
            that this number has to be between 0 to 100.
        </p>

        <strong>2. Payoff and how to get paid</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;">Payoff</strong> The total number of tokens in your group account
            will be doubled and divided evenly to all members of your group. For example, if you decide to invest 12
            tokens and the total number of tokens in your group account is 60 tokens. Then, at the end of the
            experiment, you will end up having: (20-12) tokens + ((60×2)/5) tokens = 8 tokens + 24 tokens = 32 tokens.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;">How to get paid</strong> At the end of the experiment, the tokens you
            earned from playing the game will be exchanged into dollars, with an exchange rate of 4 tokens for $1. Your
            take-home payment will include: (1) participation payment of $3 and (2) the earnings you get from playing
            the game.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin: 0;">
            Payment will be distributed next class meeting. Please carefully keep your code number
            card as it will be used to collect your payment.
